# 🌿 Plant Disease Classification Model

## 📌 Overview
This project, assigned by **NIELIT, Guwahati**, focuses on building a deep learning model for **plant disease classification**. The model aims to detect and classify plant diseases using **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)**, improving agricultural productivity and reducing losses due to diseases.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Develop a **CNN-based model** for classifying plant diseases.
- Use **image processing** techniques to enhance model accuracy.
- Train the model on a dataset containing healthy and diseased plant images.
- Evaluate performance using metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python** (TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas)
- **Deep Learning** (CNNs)
- **Data Augmentation** (for improving model generalization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (for experimentation and visualization)
